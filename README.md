# Newsbox 

A simple news viewer web app. 

The user can choose from the source they wish to view, and a list of the 10 latest articles will be rendered. 

### Developer Notes

I created this app to expand on my knowledge of react and to work with new tools including: [ant design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) as well as using the native fetch api instead of axios. 

This project is still a work in progress and will be continuously updating it as I learn more about web development.
